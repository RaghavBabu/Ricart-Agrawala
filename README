Ricart-Agrawala Mutual exclusion algorithm 

Compile: 
javac *.java

Run:
java Process PROCESS_ID TOTAL_PROCESS

Functionalities:

Reads all processes IP addresses and port from XML file.

Ricart Agrawala algorithm is initiated only after all the processes are started.

Only one process can use the critical section at a point of time.
Mutual exclusion between processes is implemented.

Process sends requests to all other process and acquires the critical section only if it get replies from all other processes.
Otherwise it waits to acquire the critical section.

Used Lamport time stamp to order events in different processes.

If two processes tried to  acquire critical section at the same time, one with the smallest process id acquires the CS.

Printed the CS acquired and released time in a file which can be used for comparison.

Handled all failure cases and the process runs infinitely acquiring and releasing CS.

Events like Deposit and Withdrawal occurs within a process and on occurring CS, amount transferred to another process.
